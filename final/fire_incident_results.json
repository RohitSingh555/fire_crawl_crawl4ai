BLOOD and JAIMIE DING (Associated Press)Published:5:17 AM MST January 16, 2025Updated:5:17 AM MST January 16, 2025LOS ANGELES \u2014 Staggered after one of the most destructive natural disasters in Southern California history, thousands of heartbroken families, burned-out business owners and beleaguered leaders across Los Angeles County are beginning to ponder another monumental task: rebuilding what was lost and charting a path forward.Alex Rosewood and nearly her entire family in Altadena, northeast of Los Angeles, lost their homes \u2014 her father, whom she and her husband were living with, and her aunt, uncle and cousin next door.Lost were the keepsakes of a lifetime of family relationships: Rosewood's grandmother\u2019s playing cards and unfinished quilt. Her wedding photos. Heirlooms from her grandfather, who served in the Navy. All things she wished she could have saved in their frantic flight as smoke turned the sky gray and her cousin\u2019s house began to catch fire.But Altadena remains home.\u201cWe all plan to rebuild, for sure,\u201d she said.Thetraumatized regionmade it through Wednesday without another major fire breaking out, after forecasters had warned of another round of particularly dangerous winds.Yet even with flames still leaping in two of thelargest fires, which have killed 25 and destroyed more than 12,000 structures, government officials talked Wednesday of the epic job that will unspool over years: clearing Altadena, Pacific Palisades and other ravaged communities of toxic ash and debris, then rebuilding homes, restaurants, schools, boutiques, banks and houses of worship \u2014 all while finding financing for it all.Because of the ongoing firefighting battle and the likelihood of dangerous refuse in burned areas, manyanxious residentshave yet to return to see what, if anything, is left of their homes. The losses range from multimillion-dollar ocean-view mansions to modest homes that once welcomed returning World War II GIs.While talking of rebuilding can be a comfort for those eager for a return to normalcy, much remains unknown.What will the new neighborhoods look like? Will fire-resistant materials and designs be used? Are more and wider roads needed to allow swifter evacuations and easier access for fire engines during future infernos?In the coveted seaside hills, there always is the impulse to rebuild after fires \u2014 it\u2019s happened many times. But there are inevitable questions about whether it\u2019s sensible to keep rebuilding in known high-risk areas, especially in an age of climate change.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a while before we can get in there and build anything,\u201d said Michael Hricak, an adjunct professor of architecture at the University of Southern California., referring to the dangerous chemicals and rubble left behind.As for new construction, \u201cit\u2019s not being tougher than Mother Nature. It's being somewhat respectful of Mother Nature and knowing what the challenges are.\u201d\u201cAre we just inviting another problem down the road?\u201d Hricak said.The fires struck at a challenging time, with the city in the midst of a post-pandemic transition that has reordered work life and left many downtown buildings with high vacancy rates.Meanwhile, planning is underway to host the 2028 Olympics and the region contends with perhaps the nation\u2019s worst homeless crisis \u2014 the latter had been Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 priority before the fires broke out last week.The government has not yet released damage estimates, but private firms have expect they will climb into the tens of billions and it could become the costliest fire disaster in U.S. history.The Northern California community of Paradise, where the state's deadliest wildfire killed 85 people in 2018, offers a glimpse into how painstaking and difficult recovery and rebuilding can be.That fire destroyed about 11,000 homes \u2014 some 90% of the community's structures. Four years later, as of last November, just about 3,000 homes and apartments have been rebuilt.The town, which previously a population of 26,000, has struggled under high construction costs, expensive insurance premiums and the uncertainty over funds to be paid to people who lost homes by Pacific Gas & Electric, which was found liable for sparking the devastating blaze.In Los Angeles \u2014 a city notorious for dense layers of bureaucracy and government red tape \u2014 Bass issued an executive order this week intended to clear the way for residents to rebuild quickly.\u201cAs we prepare to make it through the rest of this emergency, we also have to start putting in place what we need to do to rebuild,\u201d the mayor said Wednesday.The federal government already has approved spending $100 million to remove paints, cleaners, asbestos, batteries and other household waste from the rubble before crews can begin clearing debris. Robert Fenton Jr., a regional administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, called the plan a first step to getting people back in homes.Elsewhere, the agency is handing out assistance to help people with short-term lodging.Peter Dolan, who lived in Santa Monica, said he and his best friend both lost their apartments on the same day. They visited the disaster recovery center together to figure out their next steps.\u201cThis is what I got,\u201d the 55-year-old said, pointing to his outfit: a leather jacket, shorts and sneakers, the clothes he had on the day the flames hit.Dolan didn\u2019t have renter\u2019s insurance, but he was able to apply for FEMA assistance and thinks he\u2019ll get $750 and possibly his stay at a hotel covered for a few months.Michele Baron and her daughter were among those who came to a recovery center in West Los Angeles to figure out how to get new birth certificates and social security cards.Baron lost nearly everything when her Pacific Palisades apartment of 21 years burned to the ground. Her daughter made her way back to the property and salvaged a ring and pottery she made as a child.Despite the trauma, the plan is to stay put.\u201cNow that I can go anywhere, I kind of don\u2019t want to,\u201d Baron said.___Associated Press writer Olga R.

Multiple VERIFY readers, including Kimberly, Jeff, Trish and Karin, asked if that\u2019s true.THE QUESTIONDid Mexico and Canada send firefighters to California to help combat the Los Angeles wildfires?THE SOURCESCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire)Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum PardoCalifornia Gov. Gavin NewsomCanadian Prime Minister Justin TrudeauGovernment of CanadaU.S. Forest ServiceNational Interagency Fire CenterTHE ANSWERYes, Mexico and Canada sent firefighters to California to help combat the Los Angeles wildfires.Sign up for the VERIFY Fast Facts newsletter here.WHAT WE FOUNDMexico and Canada have sent firefighters to southern California to help battle the Los Angeles-area wildfires, according to Mexico\u2019s president, Canada\u2019s prime minister, California\u2019s governor and Cal Fire.Cal Fire said in an Instagram poston Saturday, Jan. 11, that the state has \u201cexpanded its response efforts, welcoming assistance from Texas, Canada and Mexico\u201d to join U.S. states providing support in southern California. Those states include Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado, Idaho and New Mexico, according to Cal Fire.That same day,Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announcedthat a humanitarian aid group including firefighters was on its way to Los Angeles. Firefighters from Mexico arrived at LAX on Saturday afternoon,California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a post on X.The support from Mexico includes more than 70 firefighters and disaster relief workers from the country\u2019s National Forestry Commission and Ministry of Defense,Newsom said in a press release. Firefighters from Mexico were specifically tasked with forminghand crewsto assist with firefighting operations, he added.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a Jan. 12 post on Xthat the country was \u201cdeploying 60 firefighters to help battle the California wildfires.\u201d Firefighters from the countrywere on the ground by the next day, with more crews on the way, according to Trudeau.The Canadian government provided an updateon its response to the California wildfires on Tuesday, Jan. 14.Alberta sent a crew of 40 wildland firefighters and two support staff to southern California on Jan. 13. The province is also preparing water bombers and contracted night vision helicopters in case they are needed, the Canadian government said.Water bomber planesskim the surface of a body of water, scoop water into a tank and then drop it on a fire.British Columbia sent a team of senior technical staff to help with incident command work as part of the province\u2019s long-standing relationship with Cal Fire. Qu\u00e9bec, which has already deployed several CL-415 water bomber planes to southern California, also has 60 wildland firefighters on standby.Canada said it was prepared to send more firefighters from the federal government, military and other provinces to southern California if needed.This isn\u2019t the first time firefighters from Mexico and Canada have helped battle wildfires in the U.S.Mexico deployed 100 firefightersto support fire suppression efforts in California in September 2020, the U.S. Forest Service said.\"Fires do not have borders, fires do not have different languages and cultures. In the end we all speak the same language when it comes to fighting fire,\" Eduardo Cruz, National Fire Director of Mexico\u2019sCONAFOR, said at the time.In 2016,the National Interagency Fire Center said Canada had helped the U.S.battle other wildfires in recent years, providing fire managers, large air tankers, water scoopers, smokejumpers and wildland fire crews.The U.S. has also supported Canada and Mexico in their own firefighting efforts in the past by sending American firefighters and planes to assist the countries.An agreement between the U.S. and Mexico that\u2019s been in place since 1999 allows the countries to work together to put out fires,the U.S. Forest Service says. In April 2011,severalU.S.C-130 cargo planeshelped battle wildfires in Mexico.More recently, in 2023, theU.S. sent hundreds of firefighters to Canada. President Joe Bidensaid in June 2023that \u201cmore than 600 U.S. firefighters, support personnel and firefighting assets\u201d had been deployed to Canada since May of that year.Related ArticlesYes, State Farm ended insurance coverage for many in the Pacific Palisades in 2024No, California did not reject or delay out-of-state fire trucks for emissions testsFact-checking viral \u2018lone survivor\u2019 house images from California firesTheVERIFYteam works to separate fact from fiction so that you can understand what is true and false.

Multiple VERIFY readers, including Kimberly, Jeff, Trish and Karin, asked if that\u2019s true.THE QUESTIONDid Mexico and Canada send firefighters to California to help combat the Los Angeles wildfires?THE SOURCESCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire)Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum PardoCalifornia Gov. Gavin NewsomCanadian Prime Minister Justin TrudeauGovernment of CanadaU.S. Forest ServiceNational Interagency Fire CenterTHE ANSWERYes, Mexico and Canada sent firefighters to California to help combat the Los Angeles wildfires.Sign up for the VERIFY Fast Facts newsletter here.WHAT WE FOUNDMexico and Canada have sent firefighters to southern California to help battle the Los Angeles-area wildfires, according to Mexico\u2019s president, Canada\u2019s prime minister, California\u2019s governor and Cal Fire.Cal Fire said in an Instagram poston Saturday, Jan. 11, that the state has \u201cexpanded its response efforts, welcoming assistance from Texas, Canada and Mexico\u201d to join U.S. states providing support in southern California. Those states include Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado, Idaho and New Mexico, according to Cal Fire.That same day,Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announcedthat a humanitarian aid group including firefighters was on its way to Los Angeles. Firefighters from Mexico arrived at LAX on Saturday afternoon,California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a post on X.The support from Mexico includes more than 70 firefighters and disaster relief workers from the country\u2019s National Forestry Commission and Ministry of Defense,Newsom said in a press release. Firefighters from Mexico were specifically tasked with forminghand crewsto assist with firefighting operations, he added.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a Jan. 12 post on Xthat the country was \u201cdeploying 60 firefighters to help battle the California wildfires.\u201d Firefighters from the countrywere on the ground by the next day, with more crews on the way, according to Trudeau.The Canadian government provided an updateon its response to the California wildfires on Tuesday, Jan. 14.Alberta sent a crew of 40 wildland firefighters and two support staff to southern California on Jan. 13. The province is also preparing water bombers and contracted night vision helicopters in case they are needed, the Canadian government said.Water bomber planesskim the surface of a body of water, scoop water into a tank and then drop it on a fire.British Columbia sent a team of senior technical staff to help with incident command work as part of the province\u2019s long-standing relationship with Cal Fire. Qu\u00e9bec, which has already deployed several CL-415 water bomber planes to southern California, also has 60 wildland firefighters on standby.Canada said it was prepared to send more firefighters from the federal government, military and other provinces to southern California if needed.This isn\u2019t the first time firefighters from Mexico and Canada have helped battle wildfires in the U.S.Mexico deployed 100 firefightersto support fire suppression efforts in California in September 2020, the U.S. Forest Service said.\"Fires do not have borders, fires do not have different languages and cultures. In the end we all speak the same language when it comes to fighting fire,\" Eduardo Cruz, National Fire Director of Mexico\u2019sCONAFOR, said at the time.In 2016,the National Interagency Fire Center said Canada had helped the U.S.battle other wildfires in recent years, providing fire managers, large air tankers, water scoopers, smokejumpers and wildland fire crews.The U.S. has also supported Canada and Mexico in their own firefighting efforts in the past by sending American firefighters and planes to assist the countries.An agreement between the U.S. and Mexico that\u2019s been in place since 1999 allows the countries to work together to put out fires,the U.S. Forest Service says. In April 2011,severalU.S.C-130 cargo planeshelped battle wildfires in Mexico.More recently, in 2023, theU.S. sent hundreds of firefighters to Canada. President Joe Bidensaid in June 2023that \u201cmore than 600 U.S. firefighters, support personnel and firefighting assets\u201d had been deployed to Canada since May of that year.Related ArticlesYes, State Farm ended insurance coverage for many in the Pacific Palisades in 2024No, California did not reject or delay out-of-state fire trucks for emissions testsFact-checking viral \u2018lone survivor\u2019 house images from California firesTheVERIFYteam works to separate fact from fiction so that you can understand what is true and false.

BLOOD and JAIMIE DING (Associated Press)Published:7:17 AM EST January 16, 2025Updated:7:17 AM EST January 16, 2025LOS ANGELES \u2014 Staggered after one of the most destructive natural disasters in Southern California history, thousands of heartbroken families, burned-out business owners and beleaguered leaders across Los Angeles County are beginning to ponder another monumental task: rebuilding what was lost and charting a path forward.Alex Rosewood and nearly her entire family in Altadena, northeast of Los Angeles, lost their homes \u2014 her father, whom she and her husband were living with, and her aunt, uncle and cousin next door.Lost were the keepsakes of a lifetime of family relationships: Rosewood's grandmother\u2019s playing cards and unfinished quilt. Her wedding photos. Heirlooms from her grandfather, who served in the Navy. All things she wished she could have saved in their frantic flight as smoke turned the sky gray and her cousin\u2019s house began to catch fire.But Altadena remains home.\u201cWe all plan to rebuild, for sure,\u201d she said.Thetraumatized regionmade it through Wednesday without another major fire breaking out, after forecasters had warned of another round of particularly dangerous winds.Yet even with flames still leaping in two of thelargest fires, which have killed 25 and destroyed more than 12,000 structures, government officials talked Wednesday of the epic job that will unspool over years: clearing Altadena, Pacific Palisades and other ravaged communities of toxic ash and debris, then rebuilding homes, restaurants, schools, boutiques, banks and houses of worship \u2014 all while finding financing for it all.Because of the ongoing firefighting battle and the likelihood of dangerous refuse in burned areas, manyanxious residentshave yet to return to see what, if anything, is left of their homes. The losses range from multimillion-dollar ocean-view mansions to modest homes that once welcomed returning World War II GIs.While talking of rebuilding can be a comfort for those eager for a return to normalcy, much remains unknown.What will the new neighborhoods look like? Will fire-resistant materials and designs be used? Are more and wider roads needed to allow swifter evacuations and easier access for fire engines during future infernos?In the coveted seaside hills, there always is the impulse to rebuild after fires \u2014 it\u2019s happened many times. But there are inevitable questions about whether it\u2019s sensible to keep rebuilding in known high-risk areas, especially in an age of climate change.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a while before we can get in there and build anything,\u201d said Michael Hricak, an adjunct professor of architecture at the University of Southern California., referring to the dangerous chemicals and rubble left behind.As for new construction, \u201cit\u2019s not being tougher than Mother Nature. It's being somewhat respectful of Mother Nature and knowing what the challenges are.\u201d\u201cAre we just inviting another problem down the road?\u201d Hricak said.The fires struck at a challenging time, with the city in the midst of a post-pandemic transition that has reordered work life and left many downtown buildings with high vacancy rates.Meanwhile, planning is underway to host the 2028 Olympics and the region contends with perhaps the nation\u2019s worst homeless crisis \u2014 the latter had been Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 priority before the fires broke out last week.The government has not yet released damage estimates, but private firms have expect they will climb into the tens of billions and it could become the costliest fire disaster in U.S. history.The Northern California community of Paradise, where the state's deadliest wildfire killed 85 people in 2018, offers a glimpse into how painstaking and difficult recovery and rebuilding can be.That fire destroyed about 11,000 homes \u2014 some 90% of the community's structures. Four years later, as of last November, just about 3,000 homes and apartments have been rebuilt.The town, which previously a population of 26,000, has struggled under high construction costs, expensive insurance premiums and the uncertainty over funds to be paid to people who lost homes by Pacific Gas & Electric, which was found liable for sparking the devastating blaze.In Los Angeles \u2014 a city notorious for dense layers of bureaucracy and government red tape \u2014 Bass issued an executive order this week intended to clear the way for residents to rebuild quickly.\u201cAs we prepare to make it through the rest of this emergency, we also have to start putting in place what we need to do to rebuild,\u201d the mayor said Wednesday.The federal government already has approved spending $100 million to remove paints, cleaners, asbestos, batteries and other household waste from the rubble before crews can begin clearing debris. Robert Fenton Jr., a regional administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, called the plan a first step to getting people back in homes.Elsewhere, the agency is handing out assistance to help people with short-term lodging.Peter Dolan, who lived in Santa Monica, said he and his best friend both lost their apartments on the same day. They visited the disaster recovery center together to figure out their next steps.\u201cThis is what I got,\u201d the 55-year-old said, pointing to his outfit: a leather jacket, shorts and sneakers, the clothes he had on the day the flames hit.Dolan didn\u2019t have renter\u2019s insurance, but he was able to apply for FEMA assistance and thinks he\u2019ll get $750 and possibly his stay at a hotel covered for a few months.Michele Baron and her daughter were among those who came to a recovery center in West Los Angeles to figure out how to get new birth certificates and social security cards.Baron lost nearly everything when her Pacific Palisades apartment of 21 years burned to the ground. Her daughter made her way back to the property and salvaged a ring and pottery she made as a child.Despite the trauma, the plan is to stay put.\u201cNow that I can go anywhere, I kind of don\u2019t want to,\u201d Baron said.___Associated Press writer Olga R.
